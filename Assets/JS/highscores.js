// enables clearing of scores on click



// In this code, I've used the getElementById method to select the elements in the HTML and then used the addEventListener method to attach the startQuiz function to the start button. I've also used the classList.add, classList.remove and innerHTML property to manipulate the visibility of elements in the HTML.

// You also need to make sure that the questions array, currentQuestion, score and time variables are defined and initialized before this script runs.

// You can do this by defining them in a separate JavaScript file and linking it in the HTML or by defining them in the script tag that comes before the script that you posted above.

// Hope this helps!
